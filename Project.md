# OutfitBuddy: Your AI Fashion Assistant

## Project Description

OutfitBuddy is a virtual fashion consultant that provides real-time styling advice through video chat with Google's Gemini 2.0 AI. This interactive application functions as a fashion-savvy best friend that helps users make confident clothing choices by analyzing their outfits through their camera and providing personalized recommendations. The AI can see users' clothing combinations, hear their styling questions, and respond with both text and voice feedback about colors, fit, accessories, and occasion-appropriateness.

The application leverages Gemini 2.0's multimodal capabilities to understand visual fashion elements (patterns, colors, styles) while maintaining a natural conversation flow. OutfitBuddy offers honest, constructive feedback on outfit choices and makes specific suggestions based on the event type, time of day, and user's style preferences - just like having a personal stylist at home.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend Framework**: Next.js 15.1.7 with React 19
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- **AI Integration**: Google Gemini 2.0 Flash API
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket API
- **Audio Processing**: Web Audio API, AudioWorklet
- **Media Handling**: 
  - Video capture via getUserMedia API
  - Audio processing with custom AudioWorklet
  - PCM/WAV audio conversion
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives for accessible components
- **TypeScript**: For type-safe code
- **Base64 Encoding/Decoding**: For media data transmission

## Project Aim and Outcome

### Aim
The primary goal was to create a virtual fashion consultant that can analyze users' outfits through a camera and provide real-time styling advice. Specifically, OutfitBuddy aimed to:

1. Implement a fashion-savvy AI assistant that can see and analyze clothing combinations
2. Process visual fashion elements and user speech in real-time
3. Enable natural conversation about styling choices with transcription
4. Create an intuitive interface that feels like chatting with a personal stylist
5. Demonstrate how AI can provide practical fashion advice in a conversational manner

### Outcome
The project successfully delivered:

- A functional web application that processes both visual and audio input in real-time
- Live audio feedback from the AI with synchronized responses
- A chat interface that displays transcribed AI responses
- A system that can analyze visual data (outfits) and provide contextual feedback
- A demonstration of how WebSockets can be used with AI API services for real-time communication
- An example of implementing AudioWorklet for efficient audio processing
